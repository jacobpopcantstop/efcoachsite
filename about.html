                <h2>The Unconventional Path</h2>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <h3>Why I Do This Work</h3>
                    <p>I've spent my career at the intersection of education and engagement—figuring out how to reach students who've been labeled "difficult" or "unmotivated" by systems that weren't designed for their brains.</p>
                    <p>My background in Special Education taught me the science: how executive function develops, why some brains struggle with planning and impulse control, and what actually helps. But it also showed me what doesn't work—namely, more worksheets, more lectures, more "try harder."</p>
                    <p>My training in improv and comedy taught me the art: how to connect with anyone, how to make a room feel safe for failure, and how to turn frustration into play. When you're doing improv, you can't be in your head. You have to respond, adapt, and keep going. That's exactly what executive function is.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <h3>The "Aha" Moment</h3>
                    <p>I discovered the power of games when I started using chess with a student who refused to engage with anything academic. He was bright—everyone knew it—but homework felt like torture.</p>
                    <p>Chess was different. It had stakes. It was competitive. And critically, every loss was immediate feedback on "I moved too fast" or "I didn't think ahead." We could talk about his impulsivity without it feeling like a lecture.</p>
                    <p>Within months, he started applying the same "stop and think" approach to his schoolwork. Not because I told him to—because he'd discovered, through the game, that it worked.</p>
                    <p>That's when I realized: the game isn't a reward for doing the "real work." The game <em>is</em> the work.</p>

                        <p>My foundation is in Special Education—understanding how learning differences work, what accommodations actually help, and how to navigate school systems.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>I understand IEPs, 504s, and educational law</li>
                            <li>I know the difference between accommodation and remediation</li>
                            <li>I can communicate with schools as a peer, not just a parent</li>

                    <div class="skill-details">
                        <p>I've trained in improvisational theater and comedy writing. It sounds unrelated to education—until you realize that improv is basically cognitive flexibility training in disguise.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>I can connect with students who are resistant or guarded</li>

                            <li>I teach adaptability through improv exercises</li>
                            <li>Sessions feel more like play than work</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>I use chess as a biofeedback device for impulse control</li>

                            <li>I can meet students at their level in these games</li>

                    <h3>Engagement First</h3>
                    <p>If a student isn't engaged, nothing else matters. I'd rather play chess and make incremental progress than do worksheets and create resentment. Buy-in is the foundation of change.</p>

                    <h3>Skills Over Content</h3>
                    <p>I don't teach algebra. I teach the executive function skills that let a student tackle algebra on their own—planning, starting, persisting, and recovering from mistakes.</p>

                    <h3>Progress Over Perfection</h3>
                    <p>Executive function develops slowly. I celebrate small wins and focus on trends, not single data points. A bad week isn't failure—it's information.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Neurodivergent students have been talked at, lectured, and "fixed" their whole lives. I approach them as collaborators. Their insights about their own brains matter.</p>
                </div>

                    <div class="philosophy-number">05</div>
                    <h3>Fun Is Functional</h3>
                    <p>Play isn't a reward—it's a mechanism. Games create the conditions for learning: low stakes, immediate feedback, intrinsic motivation. That's not soft; that's science.</p>

                    <h3>Parents Are Partners</h3>
                    <p>I keep parents informed, but I don't spy on students. The coaching relationship requires trust. I'll share progress and concerns—but not every detail of every conversation.</p>

                        <li><strong>I know SDUSD.</strong> The quirks of the district, which schools have strong learning support, and how to navigate the bureaucracy.</li>
                        <li><strong>I know the private schools.</strong> The Winston School, Francis Parker, The Bishop's School, La Jolla Country Day—each has its own culture and expectations.</li>
                        <li><strong>I'm here in person.</strong> Virtual works great, but there's something to be said for face-to-face sessions, especially for students who struggle with screen fatigue.</li>
                        <li><strong>I'm building community.</strong> Through Chess & Chill meetups and workshops, I'm creating spaces for neurodivergent families to connect—not in a clinical waiting room, but over a chess board.</li>

                <p>I got into this work because I've seen what happens when bright kids fall through the cracks—not because they lack ability, but because the system wasn't built for their wiring.</p>
                <p>The students I work with aren't "broken." They're not "lazy." They have brains that work differently, and they need strategies and skills that most schools don't teach.</p>
                <p>My job is to bridge that gap—to teach the executive function skills that let smart kids actually show what they know. And I've found that the best way to teach those skills isn't through lectures or worksheets. It's through play.</p>
